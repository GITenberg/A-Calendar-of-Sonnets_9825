<p>O winter! frozen pulse and heart of fire,<br />
What loss is theirs who from thy kingdom turn<br />
Dismayed, and think thy snow a sculptured urn<br />
Of death! Far sooner in midsummer tire<br />
The streams than under ice. June could not hire<br />
Her roses to forego the strength they learn<br />
In sleeping on thy breast. No fires can burn<br />
The bridges thou dost lay where men desire<br />
In vain to build.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Heart, when Love's sun goes<br />
To northward, and the sounds of singing cease,<br />
Keep warm by inner fires, and rest in peace.<br />
Sleep on content, as sleeps the patient rose.<br />
Walk boldly on the white untrodden snows,<br />
The winter is the winter's own release.</p>

<p>Still lie the sheltering snows, undimmed and white;<br />
And reigns the winter's pregnant silence still;<br />
No sign of spring, save that the catkins fill,<br />
And willow stems grow daily red and bright.<br />
These are the days when ancients held a rite<br />
Of expiation for the old year's ill,<br />
And prayer to purify the new year's will:<br />
Fit days, ere yet the spring rains blur the sight,<br />
Ere yet the bounding blood grows hot with haste,<br />
And dreaming thoughts grow heavy with a greed<br />
The ardent summer's joy to have and taste;<br />
Fit days, to give to last year's losses heed,<br />
To reckon clear the new life's sterner need;<br />
Fit days, for Feast of Expiation placed!</p>

<p>Month which the warring ancients strangely styled<br />
The month of war,--as if in their fierce ways<br />
Were any month of peace!--in thy rough days<br />
I find no war in Nature, though the wild<br />
Winds clash and clang, and broken boughs are piled<br />
At feet of writhing trees. The violets raise<br />
Their heads without affright, without amaze,<br />
And sleep through all the din, as sleeps a child.<br />
And he who watches well may well discern<br />
Sweet expectation in each living thing.<br />
Like pregnant mother the sweet earth doth yearn;<br />
In secret joy makes ready for the spring;<br />
And hidden, sacred, in her breast doth bear<br />
Annunciation lilies for the year.</p>

<h2><a href="images/head-apr.png"><img width="40%" src="images/head-apr.png" alt="April" /></a></h2>



<p>No days such honored days as these! When yet<br />
Fair Aphrodite reigned, men seeking wide<br />
For some fair thing which should forever bide<br />
On earth, her beauteous memory to set<br />
In fitting frame that no age could forget,<br />
Her name in lovely April's name did hide,<br />
And leave it there, eternally allied<br />
To all the fairest flowers Spring did beget.<br />
And when fair Aphrodite passed from earth,<br />
Her shrines forgotten and her feasts of mirth,<br />
A holier symbol still in seal and sign,<br />
Sweet April took, of kingdom most divine,<br />
When Christ ascended, in the time of birth<br />
Of spring anemones, in Palestine.</p>

<h2><a href="images/head-may.png"><img width="40%" src="images/head-may.png" alt="May" /></a></h2>



<p>O month when they who love must love and wed!<br />
Were one to go to worlds where May is naught,<br />
And seek to tell the memories he had brought<br />
From earth of thee, what were most fitly said?<br />
I know not if the rosy showers shed<br />
From apple-boughs, or if the soft green wrought<br />
In fields, or if the robin's call be fraught<br />
The most with thy delight. Perhaps they read<br />
Thee best who in the ancient time did say<br />
Thou wert the sacred month unto the old:<br />
No blossom blooms upon thy brightest day<br />
So subtly sweet as memories which unfold<br />
In aged hearts which in thy sunshine lie,<br />
To sun themselves once more before they die.</p>

<h2><a href="images/head-jun.png"><img width="40%" src="images/head-jun.png" alt="June" /></a></h2>



<p>O month whose promise and fulfilment blend,<br />
And burst in one! it seems the earth can store<br />
In all her roomy house no treasure more;<br />
Of all her wealth no farthing have to spend<br />
On fruit, when once this stintless flowering end.<br />
And yet no tiniest flower shall fall before<br />
It hath made ready at its hidden core<br />
Its tithe of seed, which we may count and tend<br />
Till harvest. Joy of blossomed love, for thee<br />
Seems it no fairer thing can yet have birth?<br />
No room is left for deeper ecstasy?<br />
Watch well if seeds grow strong, to scatter free<br />
Germs for thy future summers on the earth.<br />
A joy which is but joy soon comes to dearth.</p>

<h2><a href="images/head-jul.png"><img width="40%" src="images/head-jul.png" alt="July" /></a></h2>



<p>Some flowers are withered and some joys have died;<br />
The garden reeks with an East Indian scent<br />
From beds where gillyflowers stand weak and spent;<br />
The white heat pales the skies from side to side;<br />
But in still lakes and rivers, cool, content,<br />
Like starry blooms on a new firmament,<br />
White lilies float and regally abide.<br />
In vain the cruel skies their hot rays shed;<br />
The lily does not feel their brazen glare.<br />
In vain the pallid clouds refuse to share<br />
Their dews; the lily feels no thirst, no dread.<br />
Unharmed she lifts her queenly face and head;<br />
She drinks of living waters and keeps fair.</p>

<h2><a href="images/head-aug.png"><img width="40%" src="images/head-aug.png" alt="August" /></a></h2>



<p>Silence again. The glorious symphony<br />
Hath need of pause and interval of peace.<br />
Some subtle signal bids all sweet sounds cease,<br />
Save hum of insects' aimless industry.<br />
Pathetic summer seeks by blazonry<br />
Of color to conceal her swift decrease.<br />
Weak subterfuge! Each mocking day doth fleece<br />
A blossom, and lay bare her poverty.<br />
Poor middle-ag&egrave;d summer! Vain this show!<br />
Whole fields of golden-rod cannot offset<br />
One meadow with a single violet;<br />
And well the singing thrush and lily know,<br />
Spite of all artifice which her regret<br />
Can deck in splendid guise, their time to go!</p>

<p>O golden month! How high thy gold is heaped!<br />
The yellow birch-leaves shine like bright coins strung<br />
On wands; the chestnut's yellow pennons tongue<br />
To every wind its harvest challenge. Steeped<br />
In yellow, still lie fields where wheat was reaped;<br />
And yellow still the corn sheaves, stacked among<br />
The yellow gourds, which from the earth have wrung<br />
Her utmost gold. To highest boughs have leaped<br />
The purple grape,--last thing to ripen, late<br />
By very reason of its precious cost.<br />
O Heart, remember, vintages are lost<br />
If grapes do not for freezing night-dews wait.<br />
Think, while thou sunnest thyself in Joy's estate,<br />
Mayhap thou canst not ripen without frost!</p>

<h2><a href="images/head-oct.png"><img width="40%" src="images/head-oct.png" alt="October" /></a></h2>



<p>The month of carnival of all the year,<br />
When Nature lets the wild earth go its way<br />
And spend whole seasons on a single day.<br />
The spring-time holds her white and purple dear;<br />
October, lavish, flaunts them far and near;<br />
The summer charily her reds doth lay<br />
Like jewels on her costliest array;<br />
October, scornful, burns them on a bier.<br />
The winter hoards his pearls of frost in sign<br />
Of kingdom: whiter pearls than winter knew,<br />
Or Empress wore, in Egypt's ancient line,<br />
October, feasting 'neath her dome of blue,<br />
Drinks at a single draught, slow filtered through<br />
Sunshiny air, as in a tingling wine!</p>

<p>This is the treacherous month when autumn days<br />
With summer's voice come bearing summer's gifts.<br />
Beguiled, the pale down-trodden aster lifts<br />
Her head and blooms again. The soft, warm haze<br />
Makes moist once more the sere and dusty ways,<br />
And, creeping through where dead leaves lie in drifts,<br />
The violet returns. Snow noiseless sifts<br />
Ere night, an icy shroud, which morning's rays<br />
Will idly shine upon and slowly melt,<br />
Too late to bid the violet live again.<br />
The treachery, at last, too late, is plain;<br />
Bare are the places where the sweet flowers dwelt.<br />
What joy sufficient hath November felt?<br />
What profit from the violet's day of pain?</p>

<h2><a href="images/head-dec.png"><img width="40%" src="images/head-dec.png" alt="December" /></a></h2>



<p>The lakes of ice gleam bluer than the lakes<br />
Of water 'neath the summer sunshine gleamed:<br />
Far fairer than when placidly it streamed,<br />
The brook its frozen architecture makes,<br />
And under bridges white its swift way takes.<br />
Snow comes and goes as messenger who dreamed<br />
Might linger on the road; or one who deemed<br />
His message hostile gently for their sakes<br />
Who listened might reveal it by degrees.<br />
We gird against the cold of winter wind<br />
Our loins now with mighty bands of sleep,<br />
In longest, darkest nights take rest and ease,<br />
And every shortening day, as shadows creep<br />
O'er the brief noontide, fresh surprises find.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
