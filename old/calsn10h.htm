<p>O winter! frozen pulse and heart of fire,<br />
What loss is theirs who from thy kingdom turn<br />
Dismayed, and think thy snow a sculptured urn<br />
Of death! Far sooner in midsummer tire<br />
The streams than under ice. June could not hire<br />
Her roses to forego the strength they learn<br />
In sleeping on thy breast. No fires can burn<br />
The bridges thou dost lay where men desire<br />
In vain to build.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Heart, when Love's sun goes<br />
To northward, and the sounds of singing cease,<br />
Keep warm by inner fires, and rest in peace.<br />
Sleep on content, as sleeps the patient rose.<br />
Walk boldly on the white untrodden snows,<br />
The winter is the winter's own release.</p>

<p>Still lie the sheltering snows, undimmed and white;<br />
And reigns the winter's pregnant silence still;<br />
No sign of spring, save that the catkins fill,<br />
And willow stems grow daily red and bright.<br />
These are the days when ancients held a rite<br />
Of expiation for the old year's ill,<br />
And prayer to purify the new year's will:<br />
Fit days, ere yet the spring rains blur the sight,<br />
Ere yet the bounding blood grows hot with haste,<br />
And dreaming thoughts grow heavy with a greed<br />
The ardent summer's joy to have and taste;<br />
Fit days, to give to last year's losses heed,<br />
To reckon clear the new life's sterner need;<br />
Fit days, for Feast of Expiation placed!</p>

<p>Month which the warring ancients strangely styled<br />
The month of war,--as if in their fierce ways<br />
Were any month of peace!--in thy rough days<br />
I find no war in Nature, though the wild<br />
Winds clash and clang, and broken boughs are piled<br />
At feet of writhing trees. The violets raise<br />
Their heads without affright, without amaze,<br />
And sleep through all the din, as sleeps a child.<br />
And he who watches well may well discern<br />
Sweet expectation in each living thing.<br />
Like pregnant mother the sweet earth doth yearn;<br />
In secret joy makes ready for the spring;<br />
And hidden, sacred, in her breast doth bear<br />
Annunciation lilies for the year.</p>

<h2><a href="head-apr.png"><img width="40%" src="head-apr.png" alt="April" /></a></h2>



<p>No days such honored days as these! When yet<br />
Fair Aphrodite reigned, men seeking wide<br />
For some fair thing which should forever bide<br />
On earth, her beauteous memory to set<br />
In fitting frame that no age could forget,<br />
Her name in lovely April's name did hide,<br />
And leave it there, eternally allied<br />
To all the fairest flowers Spring did beget.<br />
And when fair Aphrodite passed from earth,<br />
Her shrines forgotten and her feasts of mirth,<br />
A holier symbol still in seal and sign,<br />
Sweet April took, of kingdom most divine,<br />
When Christ ascended, in the time of birth<br />
Of spring anemones, in Palestine.</p>

<p>O month when they who love must love and wed!<br />
Were one to go to worlds where May is naught,<br />
And seek to tell the memories he had brought<br />
From earth of thee, what were most fitly said?<br />
I know not if the rosy showers shed<br />
From apple-boughs, or if the soft green wrought<br />
In fields, or if the robin's call be fraught<br />
The most with thy delight. Perhaps they read<br />
Thee best who in the ancient time did say<br />
Thou wert the sacred month unto the old:<br />
No blossom blooms upon thy brightest day<br />
So subtly sweet as memories which unfold<br />
In aged hearts which in thy sunshine lie,<br />
To sun themselves once more before they die.</p>

<p>O month whose promise and fulfilment blend,<br />
And burst in one! it seems the earth can store<br />
In all her roomy house no treasure more;<br />
Of all her wealth no farthing have to spend<br />
On fruit, when once this stintless flowering end.<br />
And yet no tiniest flower shall fall before<br />
It hath made ready at its hidden core<br />
Its tithe of seed, which we may count and tend<br />
Till harvest. Joy of blossomed love, for thee<br />
Seems it no fairer thing can yet have birth?<br />
No room is left for deeper ecstasy?<br />
Watch well if seeds grow strong, to scatter free<br />
Germs for thy future summers on the earth.<br />
A joy which is but joy soon comes to dearth.</p>

<h2><a href="head-jul.png"><img width="40%" src="head-jul.png" alt="July" /></a></h2>



<p>Some flowers are withered and some joys have died;<br />
The garden reeks with an East Indian scent<br />
From beds where gillyflowers stand weak and spent;<br />
The white heat pales the skies from side to side;<br />
But in still lakes and rivers, cool, content,<br />
Like starry blooms on a new firmament,<br />
White lilies float and regally abide.<br />
In vain the cruel skies their hot rays shed;<br />
The lily does not feel their brazen glare.<br />
In vain the pallid clouds refuse to share<br />
Their dews; the lily feels no thirst, no dread.<br />
Unharmed she lifts her queenly face and head;<br />
She drinks of living waters and keeps fair.</p>

<h2><a href="head-aug.png"><img width="40%" src="head-aug.png" alt="August" /></a></h2>



<p>Silence again. The glorious symphony<br />
Hath need of pause and interval of peace.<br />
Some subtle signal bids all sweet sounds cease,<br />
Save hum of insects' aimless industry.<br />
Pathetic summer seeks by blazonry<br />
Of color to conceal her swift decrease.<br />
Weak subterfuge! Each mocking day doth fleece<br />
A blossom, and lay bare her poverty.<br />
Poor middle-ag&egrave;d summer! Vain this show!<br />
Whole fields of golden-rod cannot offset<br />
One meadow with a single violet;<br />
And well the singing thrush and lily know,<br />
Spite of all artifice which her regret<br />
Can deck in splendid guise, their time to go!</p>

<p>O golden month! How high thy gold is heaped!<br />
The yellow birch-leaves shine like bright coins strung<br />
On wands; the chestnut's yellow pennons tongue<br />
To every wind its harvest challenge. Steeped<br />
In yellow, still lie fields where wheat was reaped;<br />
And yellow still the corn sheaves, stacked among<br />
The yellow gourds, which from the earth have wrung<br />
Her utmost gold. To highest boughs have leaped<br />
The purple grape,--last thing to ripen, late<br />
By very reason of its precious cost.<br />
O Heart, remember, vintages are lost<br />
If grapes do not for freezing night-dews wait.<br />
Think, while thou sunnest thyself in Joy's estate,<br />
Mayhap thou canst not ripen without frost!</p>

<p>The month of carnival of all the year,<br />
When Nature lets the wild earth go its way<br />
And spend whole seasons on a single day.<br />
The spring-time holds her white and purple dear;<br />
October, lavish, flaunts them far and near;<br />
The summer charily her reds doth lay<br />
Like jewels on her costliest array;<br />
October, scornful, burns them on a bier.<br />
The winter hoards his pearls of frost in sign<br />
Of kingdom: whiter pearls than winter knew,<br />
Or Empress wore, in Egypt's ancient line,<br />
October, feasting 'neath her dome of blue,<br />
Drinks at a single draught, slow filtered through<br />
Sunshiny air, as in a tingling wine!</p>

<p>This is the treacherous month when autumn days<br />
With summer's voice come bearing summer's gifts.<br />
Beguiled, the pale down-trodden aster lifts<br />
Her head and blooms again. The soft, warm haze<br />
Makes moist once more the sere and dusty ways,<br />
And, creeping through where dead leaves lie in drifts,<br />
The violet returns. Snow noiseless sifts<br />
Ere night, an icy shroud, which morning's rays<br />
Will idly shine upon and slowly melt,<br />
Too late to bid the violet live again.<br />
The treachery, at last, too late, is plain;<br />
Bare are the places where the sweet flowers dwelt.<br />
What joy sufficient hath November felt?<br />
What profit from the violet's day of pain?</p>

<h2><a href="head-dec.png"><img width="40%" src="head-dec.png" alt="December" /></a></h2>



<p>The lakes of ice gleam bluer than the lakes<br />
Of water 'neath the summer sunshine gleamed:<br />
Far fairer than when placidly it streamed,<br />
The brook its frozen architecture makes,<br />
And under bridges white its swift way takes.<br />
Snow comes and goes as messenger who dreamed<br />
Might linger on the road; or one who deemed<br />
His message hostile gently for their sakes<br />
Who listened might reveal it by degrees.<br />
We gird against the cold of winter wind<br />
Our loins now with mighty bands of sleep,<br />
In longest, darkest nights take rest and ease,<br />
And every shortening day, as shadows creep<br />
O'er the brief noontide, fresh surprises find.</p>

This file should be named calsn10h.htm or calsn10h.zip

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
